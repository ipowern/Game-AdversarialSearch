# Game-AdversarialSearch
Designed an artificial intelligent agent to play a board game. During the agent turn, a Game Tree automatically constructs and then agent plays the next move based on the evaluation function and available heuristics.   End-user can configure the agent to pick either of the following techniques: 1. Greedy Best First Search algorithm 2. Min-Max algorithm 3. Alpha-Beta Pruning algorithm (Cut-off Depth need to be specified)  Game-Tree is implemented using Depth First Search algorithm.  Project is implemented using Python.
